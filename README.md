# Elasticsearch-Prune
A python tool to prune and modify elasticsearch indices

This tool can take an index file glob in form of <GLOB>-YYYY.MM.DD and delete ones that are too old.
  
  ## Need to implement:
  - Ability to completely manage the indices
  - Use regular expressions to control the glob based filter.
  - Better logging facility
  - Smart management of indices (maybe!)
